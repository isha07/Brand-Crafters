IUDs are favored for their long-acting nature and high efficacy rates, appealing to women seeking reliable contraception with minimal daily maintenance. Another significant segment is the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding, where hormonal IUDs are particularly valued for their ability to reduce menstrual flow and alleviate symptoms without the need for surgery.Endometrial protection represents another key application, where IUDs are utilized to maintain endometrial health and reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia in certain populations, such as postmenopausal women receiving estrogen replacement therapy.
